# Hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Riley and this is the first time I have ever done anything with github or general computer programming. I have done quite a but of statistical programming but never anything like this! I am very excited to work toward getting my masters and working with Python. I am bit of a fanatic when it comes to data science!
